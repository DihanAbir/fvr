            <p className='text-center'>The theme of the Health and Hygiene Pollution Conference is "Holistic Approach to Workplace Health," which focuses on exploring how various disciplines in Occupational Hygiene and Human Factors & Ergonomics can be better integrated toward holistic management of workplace health issues. The pandemic has brought changes to workplaces and how work is organized. The increasing trend of hybrid work is beginning to expose difficulties and disparities in conventional workplace health management. The workshop will begin with discussions on current and anticipated workplace health issues and challenges in this post-pandemic world. Presenters will share how workplace health hazards can be anticipated, recognized, assessed, and controlled. In summary, we will hear suggestions on how the various solutions can possibly be integrated. Come and join us at this year's Ergonomics and Hygiene 2022!
